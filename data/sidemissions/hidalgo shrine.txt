#------ TODO ------#
# Add dialog-only missions to the Hidalgo Shrine which you
# can do to explore the rest of the Shrine. Would be great
# for worldbuilding.

		log "Factions" "Hidalgo Shrine" `The Hidalgo Shrine is a large museum on a moon of Heine, Darceas. It is a hub for anything related to France; being home to many France-related artifacts, photos of Anne Hidalgo, French food shops, a French language learning school, and so much more. At its center lies a golden statue of Anne Hidalgo.`

			`You begin a retrograde burn to deorbit and prepare to land on the Hidalgo Shrine spaceport. As your altitude rapidly approaches 50km, you begin receiving hails. You swear you saw a popup of a middle aged woman on one of the computer screens on your ship, but since you're landing and you're a pilot, you can't be distracted so you continue looking forward.`

			`On final approach towards the landing pads, you see large portraits of the same middle-aged woman alongside the usual advertisements for baguettes, croissants, guided tours, and even data drives containing photos of Anne Hidalgo. The billboards attempt to hail you with the audio for those billboards, but thankfully your ship's adblocker software is running smoothly in the background, blocking them. After a few minutes, you make a soft landing on one of the many docking pads at the port. Your ship is refueled and your shields recharged as usual. `

			`When you leave your ship, several people, dressed in white T-shirts with a photo of Anne Hidalgo on the back and black pants, who you suspect are the staff, greet you in unison, one of them carrying large portraits of a middle-aged woman. Apparently, it is your first time landing on this moon. Additionally, the walls at this spaceport are plastered with photos of what seems like the same middle-aged woman as the one on the portrait. As you try to process where you've just landed on, you see a bunch of workers moving a guillotine somewhere, probably to a storage unit, or some grotesque museum exhibit - you are simply too overloaded to care.`

			`	"Welcome to the Hidalgo Shrine! We're so glad to see you here. Here at the Shrine, we provide the galaxy with information about France. If there's something you want to know about France, it's right here. As usual, we have refueling facilities, shops, and of course at the center we have a large statue of Anne Hidalgo. Entry to this place is free. You don't even need to pay for the costs of docking at our spaceport.", says one of them.`

			`	"If you're wondering who that woman is on the portrait my colleague is holding, alongside the woman on all those walls and billboards you saw while landing, then that person is Anne Hidalgo. She was born on Earth in the 20th century. She was the mayor of a city named Paris for most of the early 21st century. She is dead now, but she is forever remembered at this shrine."`

Should be 8 minutes from where you are right now.", says another employee. And then another employee hands you a leaflet, presumably containing information about the shrine, the rules you are expected to follow, and other stuff.`

			`	"I don't know. I'm only here for my paycheck. Maybe the owner of this place is a descendant of Anne Hidalgo and just wants to honor their ancestor, maybe they're obsessed, or maybe they picked a random person to make a shrine for, and they chose Anne."`

			label france
			`	"History. History is very important. Also, this place makes good money from tourism, and we're actually keeping French culture alive. Even if I didn't care about history, I'm still paid to work here so I would care about France at the bare minimum level."`

			`	"No, they're still based on Earth. Maybe someday they will relocate here, but so far no word from them at all. If you find yourself interested in the French language, there is a French language learning school here, and I'm sure a bookstore here sells French dictionaries."`

			label who
			`	"Anne Hidalgo is a Spanish-French politician who was the mayor of France. She was the mayor of Paris in the 21st century. If the historical record is accurate, then she was very popular during her tenure. She might be dead, but this shrine continues to remember her and her achievements."`
