Due to it's size, pirate fleets often use this as a staging point to launch attacks on northwestern traders and occasionally the Deep. The Republic and the Deep remain baffled as to how pirates were able to obtain a large ammount of Bactrians."
	spaceport "At the docking bays, people give you weird looks, most of them being pirates. It's also possible to buy whatever you want for the right price, but this station has no stores selling slaves."

Due to this, the residents have been discussing changing the name of the system lately but it is unlikely the Republic will approve of this."
	spaceport "Most dockworkers you see at the port have been continually annoyed at constant cargo arrivals bound for Illumina. Annoyed dockworkers aside, merchants haggle for hours on end with sellers to get the lowest possible price. In addition, Markaai is home to a large ship refurbishment company, offering various types of ships for anyone's needs."

The streets of it's largest city, Laadecki is bustling with small businesses strewn across the cityscape with the occasional chop-shop. The slave trade has proliferated deep within the planet's mantle. Amongst the inhabitants, there is rumor that deep in the nearby uninhabited systems lies an entrance to an alien civillization. No explorer has been daring enough to investigate this, and it is often dismissed as mere nonsense. Due to the large shipyards here, it is a popular stopping point for captains who wish to purchase new ships or upgrades."
	spaceport "The spaceport is busy with ships docking and undocking constantly. Air traffic controllers continue to exist, but ever since spacecraft made atmospheric-based vehicles obsolete, their main responsibility is now to control the flow of ships into the system."

The buildings of this part of Yinachr seem to match the color of the sand. Large deposits of important ship-building materials lie deep beneath the surface of Yinachr. In light of this, there are many mining operations on this planet and most of the residents here are either miners or their families, with the exception of the occasional rich person who you assume is one of the supervisors. Another part of the planet that seems to trigger you is the immense temperature differences between day and night (59 & -77 C respectively)."
	spaceport "At the spaceport, which is quite small for the planet's size, is overcrowded and extremely hot to the point where you would want to wear your temperature-controlled environment suit. At one section of the spaceport, there seems to be construction work going on which you hope is a temperature control system for the whole place."

The planet is home to a large lumber industry, supplying lumber to most of human space to provide the Paradise Planets and anyone with the right ammount of money with wooden furniture."
	spaceport "Merchant ships often stop by the area to purchase large ammounts of lumber to sell to the Paradise Planets. Most of the dockworker's equipment seem to be specialized for carrying wood, and only wood. At least one section of the spaceport is made out of wood, from what you could discern when you landed."

Crops grown here range from wheat, rice, to more obscure crops such as native fruits and vegetables."
	spaceport "The Merschre spaceport is relatively large. Many of the traders here sell food. The main spaceport, Merschre Central, is one of the busiest in the Illumina Regions, rivalling that of Laateli. There are several landing pads, some of them are unusually large, to accomodate the SPA's favorite ship, the Amidala. Most of the people here are farmers, as far as you can tell from their clothing. In addition to Merschre Central, there is a large SPA-controlled shipyard selling many types of ships."

You do wonder why the Republic has not taken any action regarding this battle, considering their role as a peacekeeping organization. You're in one of the few spaceport complexes open to the general public, but even here you can still purchase a few ships and some decent outfits."
	spaceport "The spaceport is full of ships decked out in the livery of the Sayari Plushie Authority, but you can see a few merchant ships, if any. Most of the SPA officers ignore you, as they mind their own business trying to command the fleets of the Sayari Protection Fleet,the SPA's naval wing, which reportedly consists of 3-6,000 capital ships, far outnumbering the Republic Navy."

	description "The mission office is located here. As you walk through the ornate halls, you find a large room containing several boards with jobs of different kinds."
	spaceport "There are many drones at the docking bay alongside small ships."

	description "Whereas Khoramelia is the headquarters of the Sayari Plushie Authority, it's main fleet yard is located here, on Rodoluki. Even far away from the spaceport, you can hear the noise of repulsor engines and ships as they make their way out of the atmosphere into orbit, and eventually to be destroyed in battle against the CSSF."
	spaceport "The spaceport is so loud that you were stopped and boarded by a SPA ship, during which you and your crew were all instructed to wear ear protection before coming this close to the spaceport. The officer claimed that the spaceport noise levels can go as high as 120 decibels. The spaceport is designed with extensive soundproofing, such as unusually thick walls, special frequency emitters to cancel out ship sound waves, and traffic limits. Thankfully, the situation seems to be slowly improving here."

planet Mindai

	landscape land/mindai
	description "Mindai seems to be the manufacturing hub of the Sayari Plushie Authority. The smog on this planet is so intense that there are scrubber ships flying across the atmosphere trying to capture any smog and filter it into oxygen. Lately, many manufacturing processes have moved into orbit to fix this, but due to the fear of micrometeorites, this process has been relatively slow."
	spaceport "Most of the attire the people here wear are usually yellow hard hats, basic t-shirts and pants, and some people look like they have not bathed in weeks, reminding you of the conditions of this planet. "

planet Arlok
	landscape land/arlok
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Arlok is the home of the Sayari Plushie Authority's research facilities. Here, experimental technology of all kinds are experimented on and reverse-engineered. Outside the laboratories, the place is relatively pristine however there are plans to move most of the labs to somewhere else since SPA fleets have to cross through Republic space to get here."
	spaceport "Arlok's spaceport is relatively large, with landing pads strewn across the surface of what seems to be a total land area of 1.32 square kilometers."

planet Lorok
	landscape land/lorok
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Lorok is an Earthlike planet home to a sizeable SPA presence. From what you see, it looks like this place is engaged in the manufacture of most of the SPA's products, like Sayari plushies."
	spaceport "Contrary to the other SPA planets, this one is relatively tame, with the ship traffic mostly composed of freighters and smaller ships. The escorts here are comprised of mostly smaller ships."


planet Melisida
	landscape land/melisida
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Located north of Mindai, Melisida is yet another SPA colony. Similar to Mindai, it is a manufacturing and mining colony. Outside of the main city, there are many smaller mining villages home to massive equipment and hundreds of workers each."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is incredibly boring, with not much to admire except for the ships. You see several containers of Sayari plushies being loaded on the ships, alongside the occasional 'prototype' plushies, most of whom seem to depict a woman named 'Freya Winters'."

	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Ekarai is a Sayari Plushie Authority colony. With a popuation of 45.43 million, Ekarai is a relatively large colony, rivalling the capital Khoramelia, in size. Shipyards and outfitters here sell common ships and outifts used by the Sayari Plushie Authority."
	spaceport "The shipyard is integrated with the main spaceport. At the bench where you are sitting, a well-dressed salesman is pitching a lifesize Freya Winters plushie to a group of parents and their children who are clearly wearing party hats."


planet Renpaya
	landscape land/renpaya
	shipyard "Basic Ships"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Renpaya is a relatively boring savannah world. This world is held by the Sayari Plushie Authority mainly to prevent it from falling into the hands of the CSSF."
	spaceport "The spaceport is primitive, containing only the basic essentials. There are a few food shops offering food and water, and tourists who wish to explore the planet's relatively pristine nature."


planet Denchrao
	landscape land/denchrao
	shipyard "Sayari Advanced"
	outfitter "Common Outfits"
	outfitter "Basic Outfits"
	outfitter "Ammo North"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Denchrao is a large and urbanized world with several cities scattered over the many continent. Rather strangely, 55% of the planet is land, whereas the average proportion of land to water on other planets was far lower, somewhere between 30 to 40%. Outside of the cities, the nature is surprisingly pristine and is well-preserved and catalogued."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located in the largest city on Denchrao. Businessmen in suits can be seen conversing with SPA officers and carts full of plushies, either depicting Sayari, or Freya Winters"

planet "Kestrix I"
	attributes kestrix
	landscape "land/kestrix1"
	government "Pirate"
	description "This is a moon of the gas giant named Kestrix. Piracy runs rampant here on this world, and many pirates here have their guns pointed at you. Kestrix I is the most run-down of the three, where crews subservient to the inhabitants of Kestrix II and III live and toil. Arbitrary executions for even the smallest of mistakes are routine here, and no mercy is given."
	spaceport "The spaceport is rundown and the conditions here are the worst of the other Kestrix moons. Food here is overpriced and sold by men who look like they're from either Kestrix II or III. Occasionally, one of the locals attempts to steal some food, but they are mercilessly executed. You decide to ignore all of this."
	
planet "Kestrix II"
	attributes kestrix
	landscape "land/kestrix2"

	outfitter "Pirate Outfits"
	government "Pirate"
	description "This is a moon of the gas giant named Kestrix. Piracy runs rampant here on this world, and many pirates here have their guns pointed at you. Kestrix II is where most captains, either independent or bound to a warlord on Kestrix III live. This is the only moon where you can buy outfits and ships. The captains here are actually willing to trade with you, even the pirates."
	spaceport "The spaceport is quite decent here compared to Kestrix I and III, considering Kestrix II is where most of the Kestrix Moons captains live. The outfitters are willing to sell you some basic outfits, including the notorious nerve gas."

planet "Kestrix III"
	attributes kestrix
	landscape "land/kestrix3"
	government "Pirate"
	description "This is a moon of the gas giant named Kestrix. Piracy runs rampant here on this world, and many pirates here have their guns pointed at you. Kestrix III is the more populous planet of the three. None of the pirates here want to trade with you or sell you even the most basic of outfits. Most of the pirates here are big and rich pirate warlords while lower-class crew and captains reside on Kestrix I and II respectively. There are many crew here who normally would belong on Kestrix I or on Leroo Station. You do meet a few friendly merchant captains who want to trade."
	spaceport "The spaceport is rundown and the conditions are almost inhuman. Well-dressed men (likely rich pirates) sit at their tables as poorer-looking men and women bring them plates full of food. There is a field hospital here, but it is relatively empty, and it is likely the only medical care facility in the Kestrix Moons."
planet Eisei
	attributes illuminareg animeorg
	landscape "land/eisei"
	government "Anime Organization"
	description "Eisei is the home of the Anime Organization, the predecessor state to the Sayari Plushie Authority. Their mandate has always been the preservation of anime. Anime screenings occur often on this world. As for the planet itself, the land-to-water ratio is similar to Earth, with a large desert covering 43% of the main continent. The coastline is heavily urbanized, and it appears the Anime Organization calls the shots on this world, with little interference from the Republic or Free Worlds."
	spaceport "The main spaceport is large. Advertisements for anime screenings litter the walls, while bookstores tout their 'new mangas' in stock. This is as 'Japanese' as the spaceport can get. Flags which look like red circles on white backgrounds adorn some of these bookstores."
