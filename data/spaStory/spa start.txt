		log "Factions" "Sayari Plushie Authority" `The Sayari Plushie Authority, primarily operating in the Illumina Regions, is a major quasi-national organization performing most of the functions of an actual country like the Republic. It is notorious for it's large trade caravans, transporting goods across the galaxy. However, it is even more well-known for producing life-size plushies of a character named "Sayari". You assume that Sayari is a fictional character of some sort.`

			`"You want to know who she is? Oh. She's a fictional character we made up just so we could sell plushies of her. They bring in lots of credits for our operations. By the way, there's a group that has been actively attacking us - I'm sure you've seen them before if you go around the Illumina Regions often."`

			`	"Hey, are you the new SPA recruit?", the man says.`
			choice
				`Yes.`
					goto followMan

			label followMan
			`"Alright. Follow me.", the man says.`
			`As you look to the right, you see a group of strange soldiers running toward you. They don't look like they're from the Republic. Suddenly, the man runs while screaming at you to follow him.`
			`	"They're dangerous! Run!", the man says.`
			choice
				`(Run).`
					goto soldierRun
				`(See who they are.)`
					goto soldierDidNotRun
			
			label soldierDidNotRun
			`You hesitate for a moment before the soldiers catch up to you. As the soldiers are about to grab you, the man suddenly grabs you by the back and you both run to a dark alleyway of the spaceport, where you're sure the unknown soldiers can't find you. They run in the wrong direction and the man finally introduces himself.`
			`	"I'm George", the man says.`
			choice
				`I'm glad we're safe.`

				`	"Well, of course. We're safe now. They can't get us.", George says. So, here's the mission brief.`
			choice
				`Alright.`
				goto missionBrief

			label askedAboutSoldier
			`Those soldiers? They're from the Counter-Sayari Strike Force. They've been attacking our plushie shipments since the beginning. They want to kill you or interrogate you. Anyway, the CSSF soldiers are long gone now, so let's get onto your ship.`
				choice
					`What's the mission about?`
					goto missionBrief

			label missionBrief
			`	"Alright, I have another recruit who wants to join the Sayari Plushie Authority, or SPA for short. He's already on my ship, so we just have to depart together and hopefully we'll make it to Khoramelia in one piece. Before you ask, Khoramelia is our headquarters. That's where we do stuff and it's where you'll pick up missions that you can do for us."`
