		log "Factions" "Sayari Plushie Authority" `The Sayari Plushie Authority, primarily operating in the Illumina Regions, is a major quasi-national organization performing most of the functions of an actual country like the Republic. It is notorious for it's large trade caravans, transporting goods across the galaxy. However, it is even more well-known for producing life-size plushies of a character named "Sayari". You assume that Sayari is a fictional character of some sort.`

		conversation

Immediately, she says "Hello, I'm from the Sayari Plushie Authority. We're always looking for experienced pilots. We offer high rewards for missions. Want to join us?"`

			`"You want to know who she is? Oh. She's a fictional character we made up just so we could sell plushies of her. They bring in lots of credits for our operations. By the way, there's a group that has been actively attacking us - I'm sure you've seen them before if you go around the Illumina Regions often."`
			choice
				`	"No thanks. I like it when my ship stays in one piece."`
