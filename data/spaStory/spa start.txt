		log "Factions" "Sayari Plushie Authority" `The Sayari Plushie Authority, primarily operating in the Illumina Regions, is a major quasi-national organization performing most of the functions of an actual country like the Republic. It is notorious for it's large trade caravans, transporting goods across the galaxy. However, it is even more well-known for producing life-size plushies of a character named "Sayari". You assume that Sayari is a fictional character of some sort.`
		conversation
			`Once you step off your ship, a woman dressed in a blue uniform confronts you. She doesn't look like someone from the Navy or Parliament.`
			`	"Hello, I'm from the Sayari Plushie Authority. We're always looking for experienced pilots. We offer high rewards for missions. Want to join us?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure, I'm in."`
					goto acceptNoAsk
				`	"Who is this 'Sayari' you speak of?"`
					goto acceptAsk
				`	"Sorry, I'm not interested."`
					decline

			label acceptNoAsk
			`	"Thanks for joining the Sayari Plushie Authority! We're happy to have you onboard. Here's the information of one of my contacts. Meet him on Millrace, Fomalhaut."`
				accept

			label acceptAsk
			`	'Who is Sayari?', you say.`

			`	"You want to know who she is? Oh. She's a fictional character we made up just so we could sell plushies of her. They bring in lots of credits for our operations. By the way, there's a group that has been actively attacking us - I'm sure you've seen them before if you go around the Illumina Regions often.", says the woman.`
			choice
				`	"There's a group attacking you constantly? Well, I don't wanna be destroyed."`
					decline
				`	"High mission payout? The excitement of combat? I'm in!"`
					goto falconGive
			
			label falconGive
			`The woman seems to be happy about your decision to join the Sayari Plushie Authority. You lead the woman to your ship where she presents a few datapads containing the contract and other documents which you gleefully sign. You hear the sound of a Falcon land right next to your landing pad.`
			
			`	"By the way, we have a new member bonus. We don't want any of our members to be destroyed, so we're giving you a free Falcon we stole from the marauders a few years back.", the woman says, just as you hear the Falcon's landing legs thump onto the pad.`
			choice
				`	"Wait, that Falcon's mine?"`
					goto falconSurprised
				`	"I already have a lot of capital ships, but this Marauder will be a nice add-on."`
					goto falconUnsurprised

			label falconSurprised
			`	"Well, we have a lot of Falcons. A lot actually. In the meantime, do you want to do your first mission with us?", the woman asks in reply. `
			choice
				`	"Yes, I'm excited for my first mission indeed."`
					goto finalAccept

			label falconUnsurprised 
			`	"Nice. At least you have a Marauder Falcon to add to your collection now.", the woman replies.`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the compliment. Now, where's my first mission?"`
					goto finalAccept
			
			label finalAccept
			`	"I'm short on time. I need to move on to the next recruit. The things you need are on the table."`
			`The woman exits your ship immediately. There seems to be a datapad on the table and a captain's keycard for accessing the bridge of a Falcon. Upon reading the datapad, you realize that it is your mission interface. There is a message on it, instructing you to go to Khoramelia immediately.`

		conversation
			`As you open the main cargo door of your ship, you see a tall man wearing a tuxedo with a blue tie in front of you. Before you even ask him who he is, he suddenly speaks.`
			`	"Hey, are you the new SPA recruit?", the man says.`
			choice
				`Yes.`
					goto followMan

			label followMan
			`"Alright. Follow me.", the man says.`
			`As you look to the right, you see a group of strange soldiers running toward you. They don't look like they're from the Republic. Suddenly, the man runs while screaming at you to follow him. The man notices the soldiers.`
			`	"They're dangerous! Run!", the man screams..`
			choice
				`(Run).`
					goto soldierRun
				`(See who they are.)`
					goto soldierDidNotRun
			
			label soldierDidNotRun
			`You hesitate for a moment before the soldiers catch up to you. As the soldiers are about to grab you, the man suddenly grabs you by the back and you both run to a dark alleyway of the spaceport, where you're sure the unknown soldiers can't find you. They run in the wrong direction and the man finally introduces himself.`
			`	"I'm George", the man says.`
			choice
				`I'm glad we're safe.`
					goto gladWereSafe

					goto askedAboutSoldier
			
			label soldierRun
			`Immediately without hesitation, you both run to a dark alleyway of the spaceport, where you're sure the unknown soldiers can't find you. They run in the wrong direction and the man finally introduces himself.`
			`	"I'm George", the man says.`
			choice
				`I'm glad we're safe.`

			label gladWereSafe
				`	"Well, of course. We're safe now. They can't get us.", George says. So, here's the mission brief.`
			choice
				`Alright.`
				goto missionBrief

			label askedAboutSoldier
			`Those soldiers? They're from the Counter-Sayari Strike Force. They've been attacking our plushie shipments since the beginning. They want to kill you or interrogate you. Anyway, the CSSF soldiers are long gone now, so let's get onto your ship.`
			choice
				`What's the mission about?`
					goto missionBrief

			label missionBrief
			`	"Alright, I have another recruit who wants to join us. He's already on my ship, so we just have to depart together and hopefully we'll make it to Khoramelia in one piece. Before you ask, Khoramelia is our headquarters. That's where we do stuff and it's where you'll pick up missions that you can do for us."`
