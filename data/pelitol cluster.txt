	spaceport "Moristra's spaceport is home to the farmer's market, where farmers sell their crops and the occasional tractor salesman approaches you, and asks if you want one. Notably, Moristra has very strong right-to-repair laws for tractors and farm equipment, so there are countless facilities where farmers modify their equipment or watch as repairmen, experienced or not, repair their equipment."

	spaceport "As standard procedure, there are fuel pumps. Not many people are here, and you feel like you're in a distant region of space. There is only one ship docked. The crew seem friendly and even let you view one of their plushies. Even in remote space, Freya Winters plushies run rampant."

	description `Today, most of the draconian measures implemented by the SPA such as martial law when they eventually gained full control are repealed; but a few of those measures still exist.`
	description `In the planet's orbit, there are a few hundred orbital turrets which are derelict and abandoned; leftovers from Bardanistra's resistance. They are not enough of a nuisance to the planet's orbital volume yet as to warrant a salvage operation.`
	spaceport `Bardanistra's spaceport is located outside the main city. There are still several turrets left over from when the colony held out against the Sayari Plushie Authority, but some have already been upgraded to modern turrets. The security checkpoints, normally absent on other SPA planets, are still running, another leftover security measure from the old martial law era.`
	spaceport `Near the spaceport lies a large SPA-owned military base, shipyard, and outfitter. The security is a bit more intense than the regular spaceport. The roof of the SPA-owned military base has significantly more turrets than the rest, which are of significantly higher quality.`
