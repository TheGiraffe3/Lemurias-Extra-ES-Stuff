		log "Spaceport was quiet once more. Thankfully, it wasn't another rebellion just like the Free Worlds. Workers on Earth apparently opened up some old time capsule full of crates all labelled 'GitHub'. Some guy named John told me it was called the 'GitHub Code Vault'. All of it was code. Just code. He made a point to say that the first program that they 'compiled' was the 'Linux kernel'."
		conversation
			`As you land at the spaceport, you find that it is eerily quiet once more. You enter the spaceport bar and on one of the screens is a news broadcast showing a group of workers unloading several crates all labelled "GitHub" from an unknown location in the Arctic on Earth.`
			`	"Over 1000 years ago, our ancestors gathered more than 200 million "repositories" of code and preserved them in what they called the 'Arctic Code Vault'. According to archaeologists, GitHub was an ancient organization whose sole purpose was to distribute computer code across the world, via a model of development known as 'open source'.", says the news anchor.`
			`Just as you are about to leave, one of the patrons in the bar grab your shoulder. "They're opening the box!", says the patron. You gaze back at the screen. Several computer experts inspect the first box. The camera pans towards another label on the box. The label is as follows:`
			`		Repository: torvalds/linux`
			`		ID: #90939-40093`
			choice
				`	"Wait, what's 'torvalds/linux'?"`
					goto torvaldsLinuxQuestion

				`	"What in the world is this 'open-source' thing?"`

			label openSourceQuestion
			`One of the patrons approach you, claiming to be a computer programmer. He introduces himself as John.`
			`	"Open-source is basically a model of development where the source code of the project is offered to anyone free of charge, usually under a permissive license. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where nobody except the company is allowed access to the source code.", John says.`

				`	What in the world is 'torvalds/linux'?`
					goto openSourceQuestion

			label torvaldsLinuxQuestion
			`One of the patrons approach you, claiming to be a computer programmer. He introduces himself as John.`
			`	"Well, you must be confused. torvalds/linux was the repository for something called the Linux kernel. At the core of most of the computers that run our ships, such as the targeting computer, the shield harmonics computer, is the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel has changed so much over the past 1000 years."`
			`	"Meanwhile, the 'torvalds' in the name refers to the owner of the repository, a human known as Linus Torvalds. He was the creator of the Linux kernel until he handed over control of the project to his family. Nowadays, there are several forks of it.", John says.`
			`	"Well, that explains everything.", you say in response.`
