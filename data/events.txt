			`As you land at the spaceport, it looks like the spaceport is eerily quiet once more. You enter the spaceport bar and on one of the screens is a news broadcast showing a group of workers unloading several crates all labelled "GitHub" from an unknown location in the Arctic on Earth.`
			`	"Over 1000 years ago, our ancestors gathered more than 200 million "repositories" of code and preserved them in what they called the 'Arctic Code Vault'. According to archaeologists, GitHub was an ancient organization whose sole purpose was to distribute computer code across the world, via a model of development known as 'open source'.", says the news anchor.`

			`		Repository: torvalds/linux`
			`		ID:         #90939-40093`
