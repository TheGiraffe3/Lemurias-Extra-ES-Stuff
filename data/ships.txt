	description "Once one of the most popular interceptor-class ships, the Berserker's popularity is now waning in favor of more modern and versatile ships like the Hawk. Although limited numbers are still produced by Betelgeuse Shipyards, most Berserkers that are in service today are more than half a century old. This Berserker clearly was built with mining in mind."

	description "The Navy Gunboat is designed for engaging targets at short range, and also serves as the Navy's mobile sensor platform, scanning ships for illegal equipment or cargo."
	description "This particular gunboat however, seems to be another one of the Sayari Plushie Authority's custom-built ships. In addition to that, the ship is covered with interference plating due to it's intended role in transporting plushies, which the CSSF have a particular distaste for."
