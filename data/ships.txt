	description "Once one of the most popular interceptor-class ships, the Berserker's popularity is now waning in favor of more modern and versatile ships like the Hawk. Although limited numbers are still produced by Betelgeuse Shipyards, most Berserkers that are in service today are more than half a century old. This Berserker clearly was built with mining in mind."

	description "The Amidala-class Battleship (dubbed the Amidala amongst Illumina Regions residents) is the Sayari Plushie Authority's special variant of the Kor Sestor's Kar Ik Vot 349. There is a balance of Korath and Human weaponry, alongside extra space for outfits, weapons, and another engine. A modified version of the Kor Sestor AI is installed on this ship, meaning it requires very little crew."
	description "	The source code of the modified AI is free and open-source. An installation of the AI comes bundled with every purchase of an Amidala-class Battleship."
