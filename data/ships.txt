	description "Once one of the most popular interceptor-class ships, the Berserker's popularity is now waning in favor of more modern and versatile ships like the Hawk. Although limited numbers are still produced by Betelgeuse Shipyards, most Berserkers that are in service today are more than half a century old. This Berserker clearly was built with mining in mind."

	description "The Navy Gunboat is designed for engaging targets at short range, and also serves as the Navy's mobile sensor platform, scanning ships for illegal equipment or cargo."
	description "This particular gunboat however, seems to be another one of the Sayari Plushie Authority's custom-built ships. In addition to that, the ship is covered with interference plating due to it's intended role in transporting plushies, which the CSSF have a particular distaste for."

	description "The Republic Cruiser is a relatively recent design, a much larger version of the Frigate designed to be able to take on an entire pirate fleet if necessary. In addition to a wide variety of weaponry, Cruisers have space to carry four attack drones: fast, pilotless fighters that can be controlled remotely."
	description "This Cruiser is a custom-built SPA variant designed for combat. It's primary role is to protect plushie transports, which are mostly stocked on other types of ships, particfularly the Hauler III/II."
