# Changes
## 0

### 0.2
* Orbona is now a battlefield between two governments: the Sayari Plushie Authority and the Counter Sayari Strike Force.
* Added two new governments that constantly battle in Orbona.
### 0.3
#### Annoying Bugs
* Fixed bug where <credits> would show up instead of mission payment. (Blame's on no-one here!)
#### Actual New Content
* Added spoiled child delivery mission (Does not affect gameplay but has different dialog)
* Added the data drive commodity so the plugin won't require any dependencies
* 10 new star systems
* Why is there a Korath automaton in the Illumina Regions harvesting a gas giant? (We don't know why, and we also don't know where it is, so if you could find it and inform us on Laateli, Illumina, we'll get to investigating it right away.)
* Removed an unused government (It was a reference to a certain singer from Earth, particularly in a place called "Indonesia")
* Populated some star systems with random stellar objects
#### Notes
Well, we hope this plugin makes you happy!
 
# Roadmap
### 0.4
* Better earth texture
